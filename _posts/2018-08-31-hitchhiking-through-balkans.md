[MOCK POST]

Recently my friend and I have done an amazing trip through Balkans traveling mostly by train and hitchhiking. We were wild camping, meeting locals, exchanging culture and taking tons of photos. Following images are the best of the best ones due to its quality and a fact of depicting the diversity of Balkan countries. I included short descriptions also.

Enjoy!

This town was intended to be just a stop on a road to Budapest. However, it triggered in us the feeling of an adventure. We had about 3 hours to spend and there was nothing to do. In front of a railway station we found a fountain with drinking water supply and decided to make a tea or coffee just to test our camping stove, but then the magic happened. A guy, who seemed to be a bum, spotted us immediately and bumped into. I wanted him to get away, but it turned out he was an owner of a restaurant nearby and he could not stand us struggling with the stove and tap water when we could have a coffee at his place. At first, I did not believe, but yes - he gave us free coffee and we talked for about 2 hours.

Having no more than 10 hours to visit Budapest, we came up with an idea to just chill out, so we went straight onto Margaret Island, played frisbee and met with Sarah, who was also traveling the same way!

Sofia at night is gorgeous, walking down the street was an amazing experience. Massive buildings under warm light stunned me multiple times. It also had huge, forest-like parks where we could set our hammocks up and sleep safely.

Again, we arrived in Thessaloniki at night. A cool and friendly guy led us directly to White Tower. Unbelievable nightlife of this place let us meet a lot of people there and everybody warned us about high risk of being robbed... The most interesting person was a refugee, who was going from Turkey to France on foot with just a school-sized backpack. He seemed to be very wise and down to earth person. Next day we spent on a beach in Agia Triada.

In Albania we were allowed by the guard to camp in the center of Nature Park Blue Eye almost above this crystal water!
