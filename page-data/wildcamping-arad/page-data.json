At least sometimes, because they were switching between English and Romanian entirely arbitrary... My friend was the first one to help them choose the right language - I mean he just asked for recommendations on our trip. And thus we were told about Hoia Forest, which is believed to be haunted and the scariest forest in the world. I was excited - it was along the road and it was a feasible destination. As we kept talking we started sharing music, learning languages and trying foreign tongue twisters. Romanian pronunciation was similar to Polish, but the hardest part was to remember a bunch of random sounds of outlandish language. It was so strange that I felt like I was trying to speak while chewing the glass.

The closer we were the less hope we had. It turned out that to get to a forest underneath the citadel we had to cross some private possessions, but we walked through some closed pubs and restaurants... It was too much. It would be impossible to abscond from there in the morning. So we turned back and walked away listening to chirping crickets. We took a break on a colorful bridge and carried out a thorough search of bushes nearby. It was another energy-wasting decision, we found nothing. Then we walked along the river looking for a bit of alienated area to sleep in. We found a park in reliable the neighborhood and set our camp up, but my poor friend Arek could not untangle nodes in his hammock.

In a few minutes we were in front of the entrance and... we could not pay by card. So I got a mission to get some cash. I went back to the city center looking for an ATM. They were so rare there that the one I found was located in a hotel. And it looked so expensive that I felt like I was robbing it by doing nothing but withdrawing some cash.
